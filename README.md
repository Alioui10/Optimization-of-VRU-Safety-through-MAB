# Optimization-of-VRU-Safety-through-MAB
This project, completed in April 2024, focuses on optimizing vehicle camera detection systems to enhance the safety of Vulnerable Road Users (VRU). The aim was to explore and implement the best approaches for improving detection accuracy and response efficiency using Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms.
